    @param: the name of an input file
    @pre: Formatting of the csv file is as follows:
        Name: A string
        Description: A string
        Quantity: A non negative integer
        Price: A non negative integer
        Recipe: A list of Ingredient titles of the form [NAME1] [NAME2];
        For example, to make this ingredient, you need (Ingredient 1 AND Ingredient 2)
        The value may be NONE.
    Notes:
        - The first line of the input file is a header and should be ignored.
        - The recipe are separated by a semicolon and may be NONE.
        - The recipe may be in any order.
        - If any of the recipe are not in the list, they should be created as new ingredients with the following information:
            - Title: The name of the ingredient
            - Description: "UNKNOWN"
            - Quantity: 0
            - Recipe: An empty vector
        - However, if you eventually encounter a ingredient that matches one of the "UNKNOWN" ingredients while parsing the file, you should update all the ingredient details.
        
        For example, given a row in the file:
        Inferno_Espresso,An energizing elixir brewed with mystical flames providing resistance to caffeine crashes for a limited time.,1,50,Fiery_Bean Ember_Spice

        The order of the ingredients in the list:
        Fiery_Bean, Ember_Spice, Inferno_Espresso
        Hint: update as needed using addIngredient()
        
    @post: Each line of the input file corresponds to a ingredient to be added to the list. No duplicates are allowed.
    Hint: use std::ifstream and getline()
